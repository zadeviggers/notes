# Remains of the day
I'm enjoying this book so far, although it has been quite a slog to get through.
The main character is interesting but not particularly likeable. I quite like all the fancy grammar and wording like 'one' or 'oneself'. It feels very pleasent to read.

I also quite like the way that it's a story but there are lots of long flashbacks told in a memior-like way.
