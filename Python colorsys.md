Why.
Why would they do this???
Why do they have to normalize the input and output values?
That just makes it anoying to use.
Like, you need a wrapper function for the functions to be usable.
E.g.
```python
import colorsys

def hsv_to_rgb(h, s, v):
 return tuple(abs(round((i * 255))) for i in colorsys.hsv_to_rgb(h, s, v))
```
Like, why?
Why do I need this??
It would honestly be better if there wasn't a built-in colour module becuase
